# Install from NPM

The easiest way to start working with Syncano is to install ready made Syncano Sockets from the NPM.

##
When you find Socket that interests you, use its name to install it:

```sh
npm install @sockets/user-auth
```

After doing that it is necessary to run `deploy` command for it to be installed:

```sh
npx s deploy
```
