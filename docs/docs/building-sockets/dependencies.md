# Dependencies
Sockets can use libraries installed directly from `npm` or use other Sockets as a dependency.

To add dependency from `npm` execute `npm install <package name>` in Socket folder:

```sh
cd syncano/<socket_folder>
npm install <dependency name>
```

For example:
```sh
cd syncano/hello-world
npm install lodash
```
