## What are Syncano Sockets?

Syncano Sockets are *building blocks* of your app, so you don’t have to start from scratch every functionality or repeat yourself.

Syncano Sockets combines:
- API configuration
- Data Model configuration
- Scripts (functions)
- Configuration Options
- Assets (images, text, files etc. - anything your app need)

> One of core concepts of the Syncano platform is the standardised backend building blocks which we call Syncano Sockets.

A Syncano Socket has a clear purpose — whether it is sending an email, storing data, translating a text file, or analysing a web page. A Syncano Socket is defined in such a way that it can be connected to any other Socket, kinda the way LEGO works. Combining Syncano Sockets enables you to assemble tailor-made backends at lightning speed.

## Sounds awesome!

You can use Sockets that have already been created by other developers and stored in NPM.

You can also create your own Socket using the Syncano CLI. For more information check [Sockets](/building-sockets/basics) section. You can publish it to the Syncano Registry, so that other developers could also use it. This will help to create the ecosystem that everybody can be a part of and bring us closer to our vision of the autonomous developer.

## Exciting? Read more!

If you find Sockets convention interesting, you probably cannot wait any longer to create your first own Socket. In order to do this efficiently, please take a look at a [For Socket Creators](/building-sockets/basics) section.
