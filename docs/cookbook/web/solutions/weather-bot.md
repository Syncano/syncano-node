# Facebook Weather Bot

- Preparation: **6 minutes**
- Requirements:
  - Initiated Syncano project
  - OpenWeatherMap API key
  - Facebook App Page Token
- Sockets:
  - [openweathermap](https://syncano.io/#/sockets/openweathermap)
  - [messenger-bot](https://syncano.io/#/sockets/messenger-bot)

### Problem to solve

You want to build simple Messenger bot for Facebook page which can give you forecast for next 3 hours for particular city.

### Solution

Our solution is based on two Sockets. [openweathermap](https://syncano.io/#/sockets/openweathermap) Socket will be used to get weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) service using their API. [messenger-bot](https://syncano.io/#/sockets/messenger-bot) will be used for communication with Facebook. On top of that, we will create `responder` Socket which will connect those two functionalities.


#### Installing dependencies

To install `openweathermap` type:
```sh
$ npm install @eyedea-sockets/openweathermap
```

Now you have to provide API key for the OpenWeatherMap Service:
```
    Socket openweathermap (0.0.11) has been added to the config file.

?   OpenWeatherMap API key (APP_ID)
    To find the API key, go to your OpenWeatherMap account and copy it from
    API keys section at (https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys).

    Type in value: bf0a7ccf140879bc0098a85f3b8b2c94
    Your socket is ready to use! Type npx s socket list openweathermap to see docs.
```

To install `messenger-bot` type:
```sh
$ npm install @eyedea-sockets/messenger-bot
```

To properly configure the Socket you will need create Facebook Page and Facebook Application.
Then you have to provide `Page Token`, follow the instructions to get it from Facebook developer portal:
```
    Socket messenger-bot (0.0.21) has been added to the config file.

?   Facebook App Page Token (FACEBOOK_APP_TOKEN)
    To find the token, go to the 'Messenger > Settings > Token Generation' section in your Facebook Application settings panel at https://developers.facebook.com.

    Type in value: EAAbvRMZClZC4YBAL63OHJLSMWwbSKg9BM1eojt2VU0fv95vkgURMjqDqKPUVZCuN3HjNE8fjt2TJfK8Jt68fwVAAltb8JnQjgpcbMHF9eqh2OiH4ZC0ftsJz3h5ZA7wKOWacDOQGte9b9Lhl3KKuvdrJJhIgjZAAeXKgUXmSkEdgZDZD
```

Your socket is ready to use! To see its docs type:
```sh
 npx s list messenger-bot
```

#### Creating a "responder" Socket

Now we are ready to send/receive messages from Facebook Messenger and collecting weather data from OpenWeatherMap.

We need to only create a logic which will be responsible for the data flow:
  - receive a message from Messenger
  - ask OpenWeatherMap for the forecast for given city name
  - respond with the nice looking text about the weather forecast

We will create new Socket called `responder`:

```sh
$ npx s create responder
```

Choose empty project for this Socket:
```
?   Choose template for your Socket     empty - Empty Socket

    Your Socket configuration is stored at syncano/responder
```

#### Building logic of the "responder" Socket

First thing is to catch an event about received message, to do that we have to add event handler to the Socket config file (syncano/responder/socket.yml):

```yaml
event_handlers:
  events.m-bot-msg-rec:
    description: Handling "m-bot-msg-rec" events sent by messenger-bot when message was received
    file: scripts/response.js
```

You socket config file (`socket.yml`) should now looks like this:

```yaml
name: responder
description: Description of responder
version: 0.0.1

event_handlers:
  events.m-bot-msg-rec:
    description: Handling requests from FB
    file: scripts/response.js
```

Next step is to create actual script to:

```javascript
import Syncano from '@syncano/core'

export default async ctx => {
  const {event, endpoint} = new Syncano(ctx)
  const {text, sender} = ctx.args

  if (text.toLowerCase().indexOf('hello') >= 0) {
    event.emit('messenger-bot.message-send', {text: `Hi, this is Syncano Weather bot ðŸ˜Ž 
To check the weather, please type your city name in your message ie. Oslo  `, sender} )
  } else if (text.toLowerCase().indexOf('help') >= 0) {
    event.emit('messenger-bot.message-send', {text: `It looks like you need some help ðŸ¤” 
To check the weather, please type your city name in your message ie. Oslo  `, sender} )
  } else {
    try {
      const forecast = await endpoint.post('openweathermap/get-three-hours', {city: text})
      // Creating response message
      const response = ['In the next few hours you can expect:']
      let rain = false
      forecast.forEach(prediction => {
        response.push(`${prediction.hour} - ${prediction.forecast}`)
        if (prediction.forecast.toLowerCase() == 'rain') {
          rain = true
        }
      })

      // Let's check if it is going to rain and add proper message to response
      if (rain) {
        response.push(`It looks like you need an umbrella in ${text} ðŸŒ§`)
      } else {
        response.push(`You don\'t need an umbrella in ${text} ðŸ˜Ž`)
      }

      // This event will be caught by "messenger-bot" Socket
      // Content of the text argument will be sent as a replay
      event.emit('messenger-bot.message-send', {text: response.join('\n'), sender} )
    } catch(err) {
      // This event will be caught by "messenger-bot" Socket
      // Content of the text argument (in this case error message) will be sent as a replay
      event.emit('messenger-bot.message-send', {text: `Something went wrong: ${err.data.message}. 
To check the weather, please type your city name in your message ie. Oslo`, sender} )
    }
  }
}
```

### Testing functionality

Now you can start a chat by clicking on "Message Now" link of your Facebook Page.
Type in the name of the city and you should see a 3 hours forecast for it.
